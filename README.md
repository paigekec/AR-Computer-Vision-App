# AR-Computer-Vision-App

## Project Overview
This project is a simple augmented reality application using OpenCV for real-time object detection and overlaying additional information or virtual objects on the camera feed. The goal is to detect faces or other objects in the video feed and display relevant information on top of them.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using OpenCV.
- Overlay text and virtual objects on top of the detected objects.
- Live webcam feed interaction.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV for real-time computer vision.
- Python for scripting and object detection.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AR-Computer-Vision-App.git
